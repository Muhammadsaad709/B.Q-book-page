          <h2>About Hamas</h2>
          <p>Hamas, an acronym of its official name, the Islamic Resistance Movement, is a Palestinian Sunni Islamist political and military organization governing the Gaza Strip of the Palestinian territories, which are occupied by Israel under international law. Headquartered in Gaza City<br></p>
          <p>Hamas was founded by Palestinian imam and activist Ahmed Yassin in 1987, after the outbreak of the First Intifada against the Israeli occupation. <br>It emerged from his 1973 Mujama al-Islamiya Islamic charity affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood. In 2006,<br><br><br> Hamas won the Palestinian legislative election by campaigning on Palestinian armed resistance against the Israeli occupation thus securing a majority in the Palestinian Legislative Council.<br><br> The following year, in 2007, Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip from rival Palestinian faction Fatah,[58][59] which it has governed since separately from the Palestinian National Authority. This was followed by an Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip with Egyptian support, and multiple wars with Israel, including in 2008–09, 2012, 2014, and 2021. The ongoing 2023 war began after Hamas launched an attack on Israel, targeting Israeli military bases and civilian communities, massacring civilians and soldiers, and taking hostages back to Gaza.[60][61][62] The attack has been described as the biggest military setback for Israel since the 1973 Arab–Israeli War, which Israel has responded to in an ongoing ground invasion of Gaza</p>
        <br><br><p>Abu Obaida (Arabic: أبو عبيدة, romanized: Abū ʿUbayda), also spelled Abu Obayda, Abu Ubayda and Abu Ubaydah, is the nom de guerre of a Palestinian militant who is the spokeperson for the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of the Islamist Palestinian political and military organization Hamas</p>
        <p>Abu Obaida's actual name is not known, and neither are most of his personal details. He only appears wearing a keffiyeh covering his face.</p>
